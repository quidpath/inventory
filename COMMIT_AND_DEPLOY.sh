git commit -m "fix: Disable stage deployments and fix network configuration

- Disabled stage deployments (only master triggers production)
- Fixed docker-compose network configuration (non-external)
- Updated prod network to prod_quidpath_network
- Updated stage network to stage_quidpath_network (auto-create)
- Added network ensure scripts
- Networks will be created automatically on deployment
- Added comprehensive documentation for POS integration fix

This fixes the POS integration issue where services couldn't communicate
due to missing Docker network." || {
